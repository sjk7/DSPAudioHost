Note that Visual Studio 2010 has a bug with "Link library dependencies":

In theory, making DSPFiltersDemo dependent on DSPFilters and JuceAmalgam
projects should automatically link in the relevant outputs (with the right
setting for "Additional Library Directories").

Unfortunately, this bug prevents it from working. Therefore, the
DSPFiltersDemo project has this setting for all targets

Linker->General->Input->Additional Dependencies:
  $(OutDir)JuceAmalgam.lib
  $(OutDir)DSPFilters.lib

The use of $(OutDir) makes sure that the lib corresponding to the
current Target and Platform is used. Shared.props has a pair of User Macros
under Common Properties that set up the paths to the output directory.
